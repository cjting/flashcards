To run this app, you will need to setup the following after checking out the code:

1. Install node (which should include npm)
2. This project uses a few node modules, but I don't think you need to install them manually. Since the node_modules folder is checked in.
3. Install mongodb.
4. Once mongodb is installed, start it using the default settings. Create a database named "flashcards" and a collection named "lists".
5. run app.js using node. (node app.js)
